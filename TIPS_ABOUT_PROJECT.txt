WE USE TUIO MARKERS:
0 = SELECTOR WHEEL FOR PATIENT TO SEE THE MEDICATIONS
1 = CONFIRM BUTTON TO SELECT
12 = BACK
13 = NURSE MODE, OPENS SELECTOR OF PATIENTS TO CHOOSE
14 = CONFIRM BUTTON TO VIEW PATIENT INFO
15 = CONFIRM BUTTON TO VIEW PATIENT MEDICATIONS / EDIT TIMINGS

WE USE TCP on port 8765 - because its more safe and reliable and ordered to ensure everything is accurate

WE HAVE 6 MEDICATIONS:
1: Paracetamol
2: Amoxicillin
3: Aspirin
4: Metformin
5: Lisinopril
6: Atorvastatin

WE HAVE GESTURE RECOGNITION WITH MEDIAPIPE AND ONEDOLLAR IN NURSE MANAGEMENT TO CHANGE THE MEDICATION TIMING (MOVEMENT RIGHT TO LEFT, THEN CLOSE HAND TO SAVE)

WE SAVE MEDICATION SCHEDULE DATA AND MEDICATION HISTORY DATA IN EXCEL SHEET (inside PatientUI/bin)
- MedicationName, DoseTimes, TimeTaken

CURRENTLY WE ONLY HAVE 1 PATIENT, BUT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE PATIENTS IN FINAL PHASE
